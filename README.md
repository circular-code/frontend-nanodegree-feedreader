# Frontend Nanodegree Feedreader Testing

This project is based on the frontend-nanodegree-feedreader app which can be found in <a href="https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader">this github repository</a>.
The task at hand was to write unit tests for the provided app, to ensure that some parts run as expected. The code herefore can be found in jasmine/spec/feedreader.js.
